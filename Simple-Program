# Now we create a python program, which will be put into an exxercise app
# It will allow its users measure the amount of distance they have covered
# Using what we have just revised previously This program
# We create a program to convert kilometeres to miles.
# Ask the user for a number in kilometers.
# 1 mile = 1.609344 Km.
# Convert it to miles.
# print the result.
# The followin codes are written in Python 3 only.

Kilometers = float( input( " Please enter the number of kilometers: "))
Miles = (Kilometers / 1.609344)
print (Kilometers, " Km = ", round(Miles, 2), "miles")
