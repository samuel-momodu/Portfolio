# Now we create a python program, which will be put into an exxercise app
# It will allow its users measure the amount of distance they have covered
# Using what we have just revised previously This program
# We create a program to convert kilometeres to miles.
# Ask the user for a number in kilometers.
# 1 mile = 1.609344 Km.
# Convert it to miles.
# print the result.

# To concatenate a string with a number, we need to convert the number to a string.
