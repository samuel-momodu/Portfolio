We use these insights to remodel processess and implement ideas to achive business goals, milestone by milestones.

## Measurement
To effectively measure how well processess are contributing the overal businenss goals, we set up metrics. These metrics are defined by the contrasts between the business goals, current market conditions and trends, marketing effectiveness, customers availability, awareness and type.
